# Exp 8: Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation

# Name : PRAGAHARSHITHA  NC
# Reg. No: 212222110033

## Aim:
Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to generate and manipulate nature soundscape content (e.g., forest sounds, ocean ambiance, animal calls, weather effects) using AI models.

## AI Tools for Audio Generation:

- Google MusicLM – Text-to-music generation.

- Meta’s AudioCraft – Text-to-audio and audio-to-audio generation (MusicGen, SoundGen).

- ElevenLabs – Text-to-speech (voice narration).

- OpenAI’s Voice Engine (experimental) – Voice generation from text and audio sample.

- Riffusion – Music generation using spectrograms.

- Coqui TTS / Bark by Suno.ai – Voice cloning and expressive TTS.


## Prompting Techniques

#### 1. prompt:
"Generate a relaxing audio clip of a dense rainforest during early morning hours. Include gentle rustling leaves, chirping birds, distant waterfall sounds, and light wind breezing through the trees."

#### 2. prompt:
"Create a realistic audio clip featuring a variety of animals in an African savanna. Include lions roaring in the distance, elephants trumpeting, zebras neighing, and ambient sounds like buzzing insects and wind."

#### 3. prompt:
"The music should feature soft piano, ambient textures, and subtle echoes, creating a calm and introspective mood—perfect for late-night reflection or journaling alone"

#### 4. prompt:
"Create the sound of heavy rain with occasional thunderclaps, then fade into a calm."


#### Example:
```

[SoundType: Nature]
[Emotion: Relaxing]
[Instruments: Flute, River Stream, Birds Chirping]
[Duration: 15 seconds]
```
#### Outcome:
Promotes modular, reusable prompting in experiments.

## Application Domains

| Domain              | Prompt Example                                               | Target Output                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Music**           | "A suspenseful orchestral score for a thriller movie scene." | Instrumental music for mood setting |
| **Sound Effects**   | "A creaky wooden door opening slowly in a haunted house."    | Realistic Foley sound               |
| **Voice Narration** | "An enthusiastic female voice narrating a children’s story." | Expressive TTS audio                |

## Evaluation Criteria

To evaluate prompt effectiveness, the following metrics can be used:

Fidelity: How realistic or high-quality is the audio?

Relevance: Does the audio match the prompt?

Emotion Conveyance: Is the intended emotion present?

Style Accuracy: Does it reflect the desired genre/style?

Control: Are specified audio attributes properly handled?

## Experimental Design


| Prompt Type      | Tool Used  | Audio Domain    | Observations                           |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Descriptive      | MusicGen   | Music           | Richer textures, more emotion          |
| Style-Specific   | ElevenLabs | Voice narration | High match with celebrity voice styles |
| Instructional    | AudioCraft | Sound effects   | Precise effects, better segmentation   |
| Chain-of-Thought | Riffusion  | Music           | Cohesive structure over time           |
